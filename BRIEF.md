#Sriracha Font

The objective of this project is to create handwriting typefaces so Sriracha was designed using a bullet-tip marker in order to recreate the natural look of handwriting. The special alternates make this typeface look even more realistic as human handwriting. The design of Sriracha is carefully designed to meet standards so it can be used in both formal and informal context. For further development, This single-weight typeface can be extended the family to other weights, or ready to match with other non-latin script.
