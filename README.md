#Sriracha Font

Sriracha is a district in Chonburi. It is also widely known as a name of chili sauce served with seafood.

Sriracha is a Thai and Latin Handwriting typeface. It has 3 stylistic set alternate glyph designs and intelligent OpenType features to recreate the impression of handwriting. It is characterized by this friendly and clear handwriting strokes. 

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Thai handwriting typefaces have slightly simplified details. In this case, its semi-thick-and-thin strokes need to be managed carefully seeing that it has to be readable and portray natural adult handwriting.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

The Sriracha project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/sriracha
